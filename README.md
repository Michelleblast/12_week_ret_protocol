# 12_week_ret_protocol
Repository containing code and data as part of the 12 week RET protocol synoptic project

Repository contains the following files:

synoptic.py:
- python code to create dummy data, run exploratory analysis, and calculate sample statistics

synoptic_data.csv:
- comma seprated variable file containing the dummy data generated by synoptic.py
- columns include
- - ID: patient ID running from 1 to 30 (control) and 1 to 30 (intervention)
  - Age: range 45 to 55
  - Waist_Circumference_Baseline: sampled from a normal distribution (mean = 96, SD = 4) (in cms)
  - Sub_75_Completed: 0/1 indicator where sampled 25% of patients on intervention = 1
  - PCr_ATP_Baseline: sampled from a uniform distribution (1.2 to 1.5)
  - GAD7_Baseline: sampled from the following (5-9 = 60%, 10-14 = 30%, 15-21 = 10%)
  - Group: control/intervention
  - PCr_ATP_Week_15: PCr_ATP_Baseline jittered by random value from nomal distribution (mean = 0 for control / 0.1 for intervention, SD = 0.01)
  - GAD7_Week_15: GAD7_Baseline jittered randomly by -1,0,1 (equal probability) in control and by -4,-3,-2,-1,0,1 (probability: .1,.22,.4,.18,.08,.02) in intervention
  - Waist_Circumference_Week_15: Waist_Circumference_Baseline jittered by random normal(0,1) for control and normal(-2,1) for intervention group
  - GAD7_Difference: GAD7_Week_15 - GAD7_Baseline
  - PCr_ATP_Difference: PCr_ATP_Week_15 - PCr_ATP_Baseline
